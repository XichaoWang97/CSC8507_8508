Ver0.1 :

Objects with different colors: Blue (North polarity), Orange (South polarity)

Anchor: Set InverseMass to 0.0. The anchor cube will not move, and you can pull yourself toward the anchor’s position.

Player: Click LMB/RMB to temporarily change polarity.

Besides, you can see a rotating cube, which uses an OBB collider. This part is not stable, and I still haven’t managed to fix it so far. 
If anyone has a way to fix the OBB collision, please feel free to jump in and take a look!
